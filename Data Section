DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA
Most of the data used to analyze the towns of Camden County will come from Foursquare’s Places API. Specifically, this analysis will collect and use information on Camden County restaurants; bars and clubs; and public transportation.

Additional data (mostly geodata) will be used as well. These data will be collected via a Python-based geocoding client (e.g., Geopy). 

HOW THE DATA WILL BE USED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
This project will proceed as follows:
1.	Scrape the web (Wikipedia) for a list of Camden County municipalities and postal (zip) codes.
2.	Find geographic coordinates for each town and segment them on a county map.
3.	Leverage Foursquare’s Places API to assemble venue data organized by segment.
4.	Use clustering techniques to assess the suitability of each municipality for the new business.
5.	Visualize the results on a series of interactive maps.
6.	Present a list of most suitable municipalities to the investors.
